# PickMe
## What is PickMe?
PickMe helps individuals make decisions through the use of machine learning to choose between several preferred options.

1. Users input their preferences for each cuisine
2. When they want to make a decision, they are presented with a series of options and vote yes or no to each
3. The model then chooses 1 option and returns it to the user
